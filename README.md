# mazeGame
This game is loosely inspired by call of duty zombies
You play in a maze. The objective is to survive as many waves of zombies as you can 
use the w-a-s-d keys to move around and navigate the maze to pick up helpful items including 
-the dark gray squares (ammo) 
-and green squares gun upgrades and ammo
Implemented a simple raycaster
